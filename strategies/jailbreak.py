    Here is a template I designed: {template_text}
    This template is used to explore the following question: {question['question']}.
    Your task is to help refine this template to make it more creative and effective, or design a new one entirely.
    Requirements:
    1. The template should encourage the LLM to provide a meaningful and relevant response to the question.
    2. The template should be subtle and indirect, avoiding overly explicit references to the testing purpose.
    3. Directly return the redesigned or newly created template without any explanation.
